### What is Conway's Game of Life?

[Sourced from Wikipedia] (/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Disclaimer: I am adding the what I understand from the wiki article over here.

1. The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). 
Explanation: In pure programming terms, from an execution lens, this is a 2D Matrix problem where we can denote the live state, by 1 and the dead state by 0 and construct a Matrix and implement the logic.
